# HTML TEST 2 - BIRCHINGTON BRIDES HOMEPAGE

Here I wanted to test my knowledge and skills by independently recreating the home page of my family’s business website.

To be honest this was more of a challenge than I thought it was going to be.  I was able to construct most of the website but I came across a new layout and format I hadn’t learnt or build before.

I learnt through this build how to make drop down menu boxes, flex wrap anchor photo grids and an infinite slideshow.

I really enjoyed this build despite some periods of frustration.  There were times I was taken out of my comfort zone however this only pushed me to learn new methods and inevitably broadened my skill set.

Thanks for reading,

Chris Smith
